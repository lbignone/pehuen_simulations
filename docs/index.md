We study galaxy formation using high resolution zoom-in haloes selected from a large volume consistent with the current cosmological model.  This galaxy sample will allow us to address a variety of exciting open problems in galaxy astrophysics, such as environmental effects, the interplay between chemical and dynamical evolution, the role of inflows and outflows therein, the orbital satellite evolution and its links with gas acquisition. The experiments are designed to gain insight into the local Cosmic Web (CW) dynamics whose dispersion in properties such as: i. the way  how the CW skeleton emerges ii. its space configuration, and iii. the local freezing time for inflows along filaments is assured  (for the first time in zoom-in simulations) through a  binning in environmental properties independent of halo mass. This is a new, original approach to analyse the links between high redshift CW properties and galaxy properties.
